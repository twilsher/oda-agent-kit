# Oda Agent Kit

A TypeScript npm-workspace monorepo for safe Oda grocery automation.

The project is organized around reusable domain logic in `packages/core`, with thin adapters for CLI, MCP, and OpenClaw.

## Packages

### `@oda-agent/core`

Shared Oda client interfaces, domain models, and core logic.

All Oda business logic belongs here.  Adapter packages depend on this package and must not contain domain logic themselves.

```ts
import { OdaClient } from "@oda-agent/core";

const client = new OdaClient({ credentials: { email, password } });
const products = await client.searchProducts("milk");
```

### `@oda-agent/cli`

Terminal commands for local debugging and manual workflows.

Cart reads preserve the visible Oda pricing breakdown, including discounted
line totals, subtotal lines, and non-item fees such as small-order and
packaging charges.

```bash
npm install -g @oda-agent/cli

oda search "milk"
oda cart get
oda orders list --page 1
oda slots list
```

### `@oda-agent/mcp-server`

MCP stdio server exposing tool-style operations for model clients (e.g. Claude Desktop, Cursor).

```bash
# In your MCP client config, point to:
node node_modules/@oda-agent/mcp-server/dist/main.js
```

Exposes read-only tools plus confirmation-protected mutation tools. See
[Tool Contracts](docs/tool-contracts.md) for the full list.

### `@oda-agent/openclaw-plugin`

OpenClaw plugin and skill registration for agentic grocery workflows.

The shopping overview keeps cart details available even when optional account
endpoints like saved lists or order history fail for a specific account.

```ts
import odaPlugin from "@oda-agent/openclaw-plugin";

openclaw.registerPlugin(odaPlugin);
```

Set `ODA_EMAIL` and `ODA_PASSWORD` in the environment before launching
OpenClaw, then reload the plugin after changing either value so the new
credentials are picked up.

## Safety model

Tools are grouped into four risk levels:

| Level | Category | Confirmation |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 0 | Read-only | None |
| 1 | Cart mutation | Standard |
| 2 | Delivery mutation | Stronger |
| 3 | Final order | Out of scope for v0 |

Key rules:

- Read-only tools are safe by default and need no confirmation.
- Cart mutations require the agent to display the proposed delta before executing.
- Delivery mutations require a stronger, explicit confirmation.
- No final order placement in v0.
- Credentials are never stored in git.

See [`docs/safety-model.md`](docs/safety-model.md) and [`docs/tool-contracts.md`](docs/tool-contracts.md) for the full specification.

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= 18

## Acknowledgements

The Oda API endpoint behaviour documented and implemented here was verified against the working reference implementation in [**gbbirkisson/mcp-oda**](https://github.com/gbbirkisson/mcp-oda). That project's cookie-based authentication flow, CSRF handling, cart API format (`{items:[...]}` payload, `groups[]` response structure), and endpoint paths were used as the authoritative source of truth for the real Oda API.

Key patterns adopted from that reference:

- Login via `POST /api/v1/user/login/` with `{ username, password }` and CSRF cookie
- Product search via `GET /api/v1/search/mixed/?q=<query>&type=product`
- Cart mutations via `POST /api/v1/cart/items/` with `{ items: [{ product_id, quantity }] }`
- Cart clear via `POST /api/v1/cart/clear/`
- Cart response normalised from `groups[].items[]` into a flat `items[]` array

## Planning artifacts

The repository includes optional Copilot planning artifacts in:

- `docs/copilot-prompts/`

They can be used to manage iterative implementation work, but they are not required for normal development.
